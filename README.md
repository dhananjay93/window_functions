# ðŸ“Š SQL Window Functions Cheatsheet

Window functions are extremely useful in SQL for analysis because they add new calculated columns **without collapsing rows** (unlike `GROUP BY`).  

This cheatsheet covers the most commonly used window functions with simple, one-line definitions.  

---

## Ranking Functions
- **ROW_NUMBER()** â†’ Gives each row a unique running number in order.  
- **RANK()** â†’ Gives position numbers but skips numbers when there are ties.  
- **DENSE_RANK()** â†’ Gives position numbers without skipping when there are ties.  

---

## Value Functions
- **NTH_VALUE()** â†’ Picks out the *nth* value from the whole ordered list.  
- **LAG()** â†’ Looks back and shows the previous rowâ€™s value.  
- **LEAD()** â†’ Looks forward and shows the next rowâ€™s value.  

---

## Distribution & Bucketing
- **NTILE(n)** â†’ Splits rows evenly into *n* groups (like quartiles/deciles).  
- **CUME_DIST()** â†’ Shows how far along you are in the list, as a percentage.  

---

## Moving & Running Averages
- **AVG(...) OVER UNBOUNDED PRECEDING â†’ CURRENT ROW** â†’ Running average from the start up to now.  
- **AVG(...) OVER CURRENT ROW â†’ UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING** â†’ Average from now to the end.  
- **AVG(...) OVER 2 PRECEDING â†’ 2 FOLLOWING** â†’ Moving average using 2 rows before and 2 rows after.

## ðŸ“Œ Tip
Add `PARTITION BY` inside the `OVER (...)` clause to reset calculations per group (e.g., per student, department, or category).
